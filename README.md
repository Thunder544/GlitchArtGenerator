# GlitchArtGenerator
Pixel Sorting glitch art generator I made in Python

## Use:
To use, put this script in a directory where you have image files you wish to turn into glitch art.

Edit the "fileName" variable in "glitchArt.py: to be the file name of the image. Next, change the "outputFileName" variable to the name you wish to call the new glitch version of the image. This process will not ruin the original image, but save a new image with the changes. 

NOTE: You need PIL (Pillow) to be able to run this code
